# WaterRipple2D
Sorry, the code is pure eyesore, I was just trying to get it working and after that just left it like this.
I followed [this article](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/make-a-splash-with-dynamic-2d-water-effects--gamedev-236) and used C++ (more like C) with SDL2 for graphics.
You can see it working in [this Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxynAwyW3wc&lc=UgzRRtTCn9QU6NJQh4t4AaABAg).
